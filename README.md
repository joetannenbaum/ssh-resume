# Chewie

A (future) TUI renderer based on Laravel Prompts.

## Labs

These labs are just little demos I've created to find patterns and test out ideas. Some of the code is good, some, not so much. Just my little playground.

You can browse all of them [here](./lab/). And you can run them on your own machine!
